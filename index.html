        <h1 class="intro">Hi, I'm Bryan.<span class="white-text"> I'm a web developer.</span></h1>
        <p>I'm currently using HTML - CSS - JAVASCRIPT to create and learn.</p>
        <p>I'm looking for a front end role where I can learn and grow as a developer. </p>
        <p>
          I have a background in mechanics and have been working as a mechanic for the last 10 years. I have learned
          valuable problem solving skills in my industry. Those skills tranfer to web development perfectly as I know
          that there are several different ways to
          solve a problem and I'm great at finding the most efficient solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm a fun, easy going person. I get along well with just about anybody. I have great communication skills. I
          work well in a team setting or along. I prefer to work in a team setting where I can bounce ideas off of
          co-workers and also help co-workers when they're stuck on a problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          My hobbies include riding dirt bikes, camping, almost anything outdoors related. I love music. Anything from
          chill lofi tunes to metal.
